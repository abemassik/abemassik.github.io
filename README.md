Implementation pro's and con's:

        I have correctly implemented the layout and styling of the page to the extent that it contains all required elements and structuring so the 
        links function well on all pages, the image is present, and the resume
        is structured in a readable manner. While everything is correctly implemented, I could potentially improve it by making the navigation 
        bar implemented horizontally and also extending the clickable area of
        the links, which i have not been able to do.

No collaboration was done.

I spent ~4-5 hours working sporadically on it
